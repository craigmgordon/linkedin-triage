SUMMARY_POSITIONING:
  - Senior DevOps Engineer / Cloud Platform specialist with strong software engineering + architecture background
  - Deep experience in regulated enterprise environments (HSBC) and telecoms (IONX)
  - Pragmatic, disciplined, automation-first approach; reduces operational friction; strong documentation habits
  - Comfortable owning CI/CD, IaC, cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, secrets, observability, and production support

CORE_TECH_STACK (HIGH_CONFIDENCE):
  CLOUD:
    - Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Compute, IAM, Storage, Cloud SQL, Pub/Sub, Cloud Scheduler, Operations Suite/Stackdriver
  CONTAINERS:
    - Kubernetes (GKE), kubectl
    - Docker
  CI_CD:
    - Jenkins (incl. reusable/shared pipeline components)
  IAC_CONFIG:
    - Terraform
    - Terragrunt
    - Ansible
  SECRETS_SECURITY:
    - HashiCorp Vault
    - Google Secret Manager
    - IAM / least privilege
    - vulnerability scanning (code/dependencies/images) & key rotation practices
  OS_SCRIPTING:
    - Linux
    - Bash
    - Python
  OBSERVABILITY:
    - Google Operations Suite (monitoring/alerts/dashboards/log metrics)
    - ELK/Elasticsearch + Grafana (seen in HSBC work)
  DEV_BACKGROUND:
    - Java / Spring / Spring Boot (strong historic depth)
    - Microservices architecture
    - Databases: Postgres (Cloud SQL), Oracle, Sybase, MongoDB (project exposure)
SOURCES: CV + recommendations + reviews. (See citations.)

RECENT_EXPERIENCE_HIGHLIGHTS:
  IONX (Senior DevOps Engineer, Oct 2023–Dec 2025):
    - maintained multi-env infra; standardised deployments; automated ops; improved monitoring/visibility
    - CI/CD growth using Jenkins; supported front/back-end cloud hosted + embedded Linux + python apps into Windows installers
    - secrets via Vault + Google Secret Manager; Docker runtime support
  HSBC (Cloud Architect & DevOps Engineer, Jan 2021–Jul 2023):
    - designed/implemented GCP infra via Terraform/Terragrunt + Jenkins CI/CD
    - containerised services, deployed to GKE with Cloud SQL + Pub/Sub + Cloud Scheduler
    - governance/security controls in regulated environment; prod support + incident documentation
  Earlier HSBC (Architect/Tech Lead, 2011–2021):
    - architecture + delivery leadership; CI/CD enablement; microservices modernisation
    - strong full SDLC understanding from development background

CERTIFICATIONS (HISTORICAL):
  - Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect (held previously; expiry was time-bound)
  - Google Cloud Professional Developer (held previously; expiry was time-bound)
  - Google Cloud Professional DevOps Engineer (held previously; expiry was time-bound)

DOMAIN_EXPERIENCE:
  STRONG:
    - Financial services / investment banking / regulated environments (HSBC)
    - Telecoms / networking-adjacent environments (IONX)
  COMFORTABLE_WITH:
    - high-governance / audit / security controls
    - migration work, platform enablement, standardisation, BAU automation

WORK_STYLE_SIGNAL_WORDS (POSITIVE_MATCH):
  - pragmatic, structured, disciplined
  - automation-first, repeatable deployments
  - reduce toil / operational friction
  - clear documentation, knowledge base building
  - calm under pressure, collaborative
  - mentoring / enabling teams
  - security-conscious, least privilege

PREFERRED_RESPONSIBILITIES (HIGH_MATCH):
  - build/own CI/CD pipelines (especially Jenkins-based)
  - infrastructure as code (Terraform/Terragrunt; config mgmt with Ansible)
  - GCP platform engineering (GKE + Cloud SQL + IAM + networking basics)
  - container platform operations, release engineering
  - secrets management (Vault/Secret Manager)
  - observability/monitoring/alerting and incident support improvements
  - operational automation (Bash/Python), self-service tooling
  - improving standards, documentation, best practices across teams

AVOID_OR_DOWNWEIGHT (RISK / LOWER_MATCH):
  WORKLOAD_CULTURE:
    - “always on”, heavy on-call, sustained firefighting, understaffed teams
    - chaotic startup culture / “move fast break things” without controls
  ROLE_SHAPE:
    - primarily manual ops (little automation / IaC)
    - pure app dev roles (unless strongly DevOps/platform-aligned)
    - roles requiring deep specialist networking (beyond “basic networking/VPN”) as primary focus
  CLOUD_MISMATCH:
    - roles that are 100% AWS-only or Azure-only with no willingness to accept strong GCP and transferable skills
      (Not a hard reject, but score down unless they value multi-cloud/platform principles)
  COMPANY_STAGE:
    - very small startup / funding-risk businesses (prefer established/financially stable)

DEALBREAKERS (AUTO_REJECT_RULES):
  - full-time on-site required (no hybrid/remote option)
  - commute clearly > 90 minutes each way from KT19
  - clearly high-intensity culture (e.g., frequent out-of-hours, “24/7”, “must be available nights/weekends”)
  - very junior role / large pay cut required
  - early-stage startup with explicit funding uncertainty / “wear every hat” expectation

NICE_TO_HAVE (BOOSTERS):
  - platform engineering / internal developer platform (IDP) work
  - SRE practices if balanced (error budgets, reliability engineering, not constant heroics)
  - modern pipeline ecosystems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, ArgoCD) — as adjacent learning, not required
  - security/devsecops maturity, compliance alignment, regulated industry experience valued
  - hybrid in London/surrounding with sensible cadence (e.g., 1–2 days/week)
