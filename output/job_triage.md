### Job description
About the job Attio is on a mission to redefine CRM for the AI era. We’re building the first AI-native CRM — designed for the most ambitious go-to-market teams. We recently announced our $52M Series B, led by GV (Google Ventures), with support from Redpoint, Balderton, Point Nine, and 01A. Our team thrives on solving complex technical challenges, delighting our users, and setting a new standard for the industry. About the Role We are seeking highly skilled and experienced Platform Product Engineers to join our Security, Infrastructure and Performance team. This is a crucial, dual-faceted role that combines high-level engineering strategy with hands-on operational excellence. The successful candidates will be responsible for building, operating, and continuously enhancing the internal technology platform, fundamentally treating this platform as a product with all development teams as its primary customers. The Platform Product Engineer role is centered around embodying and executing DevOps principles, specifically focusing on: Automation: Systematically removing manual toil from the software development lifecycle (SDLC) through the creation of robust tooling, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure-as-code (IaC). Collaboration: Fostering a tight, cooperative partnership with product development teams, gathering requirements, and delivering solutions that accelerate their productivity and time-to-market. Continuous Improvement: Instilling a culture of iterative enhancement for the platform's reliability, cost-efficiency, and developer experience. This mandate is underpinned by a rigorous Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) mindset. The successful candidates will be instrumental in defining and upholding Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs), implementing effective monitoring and alerting strategies, and leading operational incident response processes. What you'll do The core responsibility is to implement, maintain, and continuously improve the foundational platform infrastructure that powers all engineering services. This necessitates a relentless focus on ensuring high reliability, exceptional scalability, and optimal performance across the entire stack. Platform Infrastructure: Build and maintain platform infrastructure using declarative IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, Pulumi), ensuring all environments are reproducible, version-controlled, and auditable. Proactively manage the capacity of the infrastructure to consistently meet or exceed Service Level Objectives for latency, error rates, and availability. Incident Response and Post-Mortems: Act as first-line responders for critical system incidents. Triage, diagnose, and resolve complex production issues rapidly. Drive a culture of blameless post-mortems, ensuring root causes are identified, and long-term preventative measures are implemented as code (e.g., via runbooks, automation, or system design changes). Tooling & Automation: Own the stack of supporting tools necessary for operational excellence and developer enablement, including: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Pipelines: Implement, maintain, and evolve the fully automated CI and CD pipelines. This includes establishing best practices for fast, reliable, and secure build, test, and deployment processes. Observability: Implement and manage robust systems for monitoring (metrics), logging (centralised log aggregation), and distributed tracing to provide deep insights into application and infrastructure health. What you'll bring Applied DevOps and SRE Principles: Must have : Demonstrable, hands-on experience applying core DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) principles to manage, monitor, and scale production systems. Must have: A deep understanding of the SRE mindset, including SLO/SLA creation and monitoring, error budget management, toil reduction, and post-incident review (blameless postmortems). Desirable: Proven ability to drive cultural and process change that fosters a collaborative approach between development and operations teams. Cloud Infrastructure and Containerisation Expertise: Must have: Expertise in one or more major public cloud providers (AWS, GCP, or Azure), encompassing network configuration, security best practices (IAM, security groups, etc.), compute services (EC2, GKE, ECS, etc.), and managed services (databases, queues, serverless functions). Must have: In-depth knowledge of container technologies, specifically Docker, and extensive experience orchestrating them at scale using Kubernetes (K8s). This includes designing, deploying, and managing Kubernetes clusters, understanding networking (CNI), storage (CSI), and security configurations within the Kubernetes ecosystem. Automation and Programming Skills: Must have: Proficiency in one or more modern software languages (e.g., Typescript, Go, Python, Rust) and associated frameworks used for building high-performance, resilient production systems. Must have: Proven experience developing robust, maintainable, and well-tested automation scripts, services and pipelines to manage infrastructure, deployments, and operational tasks. Operational Tooling and Observability Management: Must have: Experience owning, managing, and maintaining mission-critical operational tooling. Desirable: Proven background in implementing and managing centralised logging solutions or similar platforms (e.g., Splunk, DataDog). Desirable: Familiarity with distributed tracing tools (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) and Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solutions. What we offer Equity in an early-stage tech company on an incredible trajectory Apple hardware Team off-site in fun places! (We've been to Barcelona, Lisbon, Malta, and Split so far)

### Job description
About the job At Longshot Systems Ltd we build advanced platforms for sports betting, analytics and trading. We're looking for a Senior DevOps Engineer to join our platform team. We've got a medium sized deployment that handles trading and connectivity with sports betting platforms globally. We have several internal teams with different infrastructure requirements and everything has to work well together and be centrally managed. From backtesting to real time trading systems to long running backend services, we have strong internal support for a wide array of systems critical to the business. You would own this infrastructure. We're hosted on AWS and we're in the process of an infrastructure evolution with a strong focus on automation and repeatability to support the next phases of growth for Longshot. Our core systems handle thousands of trading signals per second, all of which must be processed and potentially acted upon with minimal latency. We have similar problems and constraints to high frequency trading shops, but in the sports betting world. You'd be working closely with the CTO and the development team to support our production & development trading infrastructure, develop new infrastructure and detect, diagnose and help solve performance and stability issues in applications, networks and operating systems. You should be happy wading through metrics, packet dumps and logs to find and solve issues and then automate them away for next time. The ideal candidate will be highly autonomous and enjoy generating new, innovative ways to tackle problems and suggest improvements to existing methodologies. We'll give you a lot of flexibility and freedom to explore good solutions. We are a hybrid working company, working Thursdays in our London (Farringdon) office and flexible the rest of the week. Our typical working hours are 10 am to 6 pm UK time, Monday to Friday, but we support flexible working and trust our team to manage their own schedules to meet their goals. On call - we do not have a 24/7 rota, but we do have a best efforts, compensated out of hours on-call system you would be part of.

About the job Company Overview Soros Fund Management LLC (SFM) is a global asset manager and family office founded by George Soros in 1970. With $28 billion in assets under management (AUM), SFM serves as the principal asset manager for the Open Society Foundations, one of the world’s largest charitable foundations dedicated to advancing justice, human rights, and democracy. Distinct from other investment platforms, SFM thrives on agility, acting decisively when conviction is high and exercising patience when it’s not. With permanent capital, a select group of major clients, and an unconstrained mandate, we invest opportunistically with a long-term view in a wide range of strategies and asset classes, including public and private equity and credit, fixed income, foreign exchange, and alternative assets. Our teams operate with autonomy, while cross-team collaboration strengthens our conviction and empowers us to capitalize on market dislocations. At SFM, we foster an ownership mindset, encouraging professionals to challenge the status quo, innovate, and take initiative. We prioritize development, enabling team members to push beyond their roles, voice bold ideas, and contribute to our long-term success. This culture of continuous growth and constructive debate fuels innovation and drives efficiencies. Our impact is measured by both the returns we generate and the values we uphold, from environmental stewardship to social responsibility. Operating as a unified team across geographies and mandates, we remain committed to our mission, ensuring a meaningful, lasting impact. Headquartered in New York City with offices in Greenwich, Garden City, London, and Dublin, SFM employs 200 professionals. Team Overview The Core Development team builds and supports the technology that powers the full trade lifecycle—from trade origination to warehousing. We work closely with Portfolio Managers, Traders, Compliance, Treasury, and Trade Operations to ensure seamless trade flow across asset classes. Our technology stack is a blend of vendor and homegrown systems: we leverage vendor-provided Order Management (OMS) and Execution Management Systems (EMS) as the backbone of trade flow, while building custom applications that augment OMS/EMS workflows and bespoke systems to support treasury, compliance, and trade operations processes. This combination allows us to deliver both breadth and flexibility, meeting the evolving needs of the business. Job Overview We are seeking a Senior Software Engineer with deep expertise in trade flow, including Order Management Systems (OMS) and Execution Management Systems (EMS). The ideal candidate will lead the design, architecture, and delivery of scalable applications that are critical to trading, compliance, treasury, and trade operations. This role requires advanced technical leadership, strong business insight, and exceptional communication skills, as you will partner directly with traders, operations teams, and technology leadership to shape solutions that drive the firm’s multi-asset-class trading strategy. This role will report to the Head of Trade Execution Technology. Major Responsibilities Lead impactful initiatives that support trading, compliance, treasury, and trade operations across the firm. Architect, build, and oversee trade flow applications and reporting tools as part of the Core Development team. Drive the design and enhancement of OMS and EMS workflows across multiple asset classes, ensuring seamless integration of vendor and in-house systems. Extend vendor OMS/EMS functionality by architecting custom augmentations and building bespoke systems for mission-critical workflows in treasury, compliance, and trade operations. Partner with cross-functional technology and business teams to define and deliver a modern, unified, and scalable trade platform. Provide technical leadership in leveraging SQL Server, Snowflake, AWS, and modern UI frameworks (e.g., Angular, React) to deliver end-to-end solutions. Lead efforts to modernize legacy systems by migrating to AWS and Snowflake, establishing best practices and guiding junior team members. Oversee and provide escalation-level support for mission-critical OMS/EMS platforms during market hours and end-of-day processes, with flexibility for global team coverage. Translate complex technical concepts into clear communication for senior stakeholders, influencing technology strategy and decision-making. What We Value OMS/EMS Experience: 10+ years hands-on development and support of Order Management and Execution Management Systems. Technical Excellence: Proficiency in one or more programming languages (C#, Python) and advanced SQL skills; hands-on experience with AWS and cloud-native development; solid grounding in data structures, memory management, and concurrency. UI Skills: Ability to build intuitive and performant UIs with frameworks such as Angular, React, or Vue.js. Familiarity with PowerBI or similar business intelligence reporting tool is helpful. Data Expertise: Strong background in SQL Server and cloud platforms (Snowflake, Databricks). Collaboration & Communication: Ability to partner directly with traders, operations, and other business teams, and to explain complex ideas clearly. Adaptability: Comfort working in a fast-paced environment, balancing project delivery with production support. Preferred: Knowledge of asset classes such as Equities, Fixed Income, Options, and Futures; effective use of AI tools to improve the development cycle. We anticipate the base salary of this role to be between $180K-230K. In addition to a base salary, the successful candidate will also be eligible to receive a discretionary year-end bonus. In all respects, candidates need to reflect the following SFM core values: Smart risk-taking // Owner’s Mindset // Teamwork // Humility // Integrity

### Job description
About the job About Opply Opply's AI agents run operations for consumer goods brands - from sourcing to logistics to finance - freeing their teams to focus entirely on growth. Brands handle growth. We handle their operations. There are currently 1 million SMB consumer goods brands ordering over $1 trillion of raw ingredients per year - imagine this was all ordered on one platform. These brands all order separately today, and have small teams/order volumes which results in them wasting 70% stock, and getting ingredients at a 40% higher price than market rate. Opply automates the entire ingredient ordering process through: Partnering with the world's biggest suppliers, giving SMB's access to their pricing through an AI matching and forecasting proprietary model AI self learning platform that orders the ingredients when and where you need them Data-led credit that allows brands to sell their goods before they pay for the ingredients We work with a lot of the most exciting brands and suppliers in this space, and are shaping innovation in a world that didn't have this before, if you're a trailblazer, come join us! Who We Are We’re a close-knit team of 25, working across five time zones, and we meet up every year to work, ideate and hang out (most recent trips have been to Finland, Prague and Ibiza)! We're VC-backed by some of the world's top investors like Index, Anthemis and Chalfen Ventures, and unicorn angels from GoCardless, Flow.io and Trouva, and have won StartUp of the Year for Technology Services and Supply Chain Specialists of the Year at the Startup and Global Corporate LiveWire awards - achievements we’re super proud of! Who You Are 5+ years enabling teams to ship great products in fast-paced startups: You've built and maintained the infrastructure, tooling, and platforms that let engineering teams move fast. You thrive in environments where reliability, developer experience, and speed of iteration all matter equally. You are empathetic and collaborative: You work well with others, creating alignment and trust across teams to achieve meaningful outcomes together. You are deeply experienced with AWS, and agnostic on everything else: You've mastered AWS and can design, deploy, and operate production systems with confidence. Beyond that, you're comfortable supporting teams working across different languages, frameworks, and toolchains - adapting to whatever they need to ship. You've embraced AI as your primary development tool: You use AI coding tools like Claude Code, Cursor, or similar daily - not occasionally, but as your core workflow. You've fundamentally transformed how you build software: you architect and orchestrate rather than write code line-by-line. Crucially, you know how to help teams building agentic-native products take full advantage of these tools - optimising their environments, workflows, and infrastructure to maximise what AI-assisted development can deliver. Agentic by nature: You think in systems of intelligent, autonomous components - whether that's people or software. You use AI tools regularly, understand their potential and limits, and are excited about building platforms that enable products which reason, act, and collaborate to deliver real value. You get things done: You move with focus and purpose, delivering work that drives business impact rather than just output for its own sake. You are resourceful and independent: You know how to find your way forward, make progress even with limited information, and help those around you do the same. You care deeply about outcomes: You take pride in pushing boundaries and going the extra mile to deliver great results for the platform, the team, and the business. What The Job Involves Maximise our capacity to build agentic systems - and to build with them: You'll ensure our infrastructure, tooling, and developer workflows are optimised for teams shipping AI-native products at pace, while also leveraging agentic approaches in how we operate and automate. Own our architecture end to end: From infrastructure design and deployment pipelines to observability and security, you'll take full ownership of how our systems are built, run, and scaled. Lead execution from concept to delivery: You'll drive infrastructure initiatives yourself and with others, working with technical stakeholders across the business - engineers, data teams, and leadership - to ensure progress, quality, and short iteration cycles. Keep everyone aligned: You'll make sure stakeholders, your squad, and adjacent tech groups always know where things stand, what's next, and why it matters. Stay hands-on: You'll write code, review pull requests, refine architecture, and collaborate closely with others - particularly our Data Engineer as part of the Platform Squad - maintaining ownership over what reaches production and how each component fits together. Spot and fix issues early: You'll recognise when a plan or implementation isn't working, rally the right people, and re-align fast to keep delivery on track. Elevate agentic thinking and developer efficiency: You'll champion how intelligent automation can improve our platform, while relentlessly improving developer setup, tooling, and workflows so the team can ship faster with less friction. Focus relentlessly on impact: You'll continuously ensure your time and the squad's energy are invested where they drive the most meaningful outcomes for the business. What We Offer Compensation £50k-£80k (or equivalent in local currency) Equity in one of the fastest-growing startups in London 25 days holiday a year (+ local public holidays) A nice office in the center of London (close to Liverpool Street) Enrolment into the company Pension Scheme Monthly allowance for gym membership etc. Regular team socials & lots of other surprises Hiring Process Intro call with our Head of Engineering (30 minutes) Meet our co-founder and CTO (30 minutes) Live Challenge with the Tech Team (60 to 90 minutes) Meet the team (30 to 60 minutes)

### Job description
About the job We’re looking for a DevOps Engineer who can confidently support client delivery while helping us grow the next generation of cloud and DevOps capability through our TeckAcademy. In this role, around 80% of your time will be spent in client-facing, chargeable delivery, working alongside product and delivery teams to help design, build and operate resilient, secure and scalable cloud platforms. The remaining 20% will be focused on coaching and mentoring DevOps apprentices - helping them develop real-world skills and confidence as they progress through our apprenticeship programmes. You’ll work across infrastructure as code, CI/CD, cloud platforms (especially Azure and Google Cloud Platform), automation and observability. You’ll also be instrumental in shaping how we embed coaching and capability building into delivery so that both apprentices and client teams benefit from your expertise. Key Responsibilities Deliver high-quality DevOps and cloud engineering work for clients, including infrastructure, automation and release pipelines. Design, build and maintain Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using tools like Terraform, Pulumi or similar. Develop and enhance CI/CD pipelines that embed testing, security and multi-environment deployment practices. Provision, operate and optimise cloud environments (especially Azure and GCP) ensuring reliability, security and cost-efficiency. Implement containerisation and orchestration patterns (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to support scalable platforms. Embed observability practices, including monitoring, logging and alerting that empower teams to own operational outcomes. Integrate security into delivery through secure defaults, secrets management and policy-as-code practices. Partner with delivery teams to translate client requirements into practical DevOps solutions. Line Manage and mentor DevOps apprentices as part of our TeckAcademy programme, providing feedback, guidance and support as they build capability. Contribute to the evolution of DevOps standards, tooling and best practices across teams. Who you are and How you’ll make an impact You’re a DevOps practitioner who loves both hands-on delivery and helping others grow. You know when to drive technical solutions and when to step back and support learning - from apprentices to seasoned engineers. You balance quality with pace and enjoy working collaboratively across delivery, product and coaching contexts. Eligible to obtain UK Security Check (SC) clearance, which is required for many of our client engagements. You’ll bring: Proven experience working in DevOps or cloud engineering roles, delivering real-world solutions with measurable impact. Strong expertise in AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - including compute, networking, identity, monitoring and cost management. Practical experience with Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD tooling. A clear understanding of modern delivery practices (DevOps, GitOps, automation, observability). A genuine interest in coaching and mentoring; you’re comfortable giving and receiving feedback, and you help people grow. A collaborative mindset - you work well with delivery teams, stakeholders and apprentices alike. Strong communication skills, with the ability to explain technical concepts clearly. A service mindset and commitment to building capability that lasts beyond individual engagements. Success in this role means: Clients recognise the value you bring in delivering reliable, scalable cloud platforms. DevOps apprentices make measurable progress and feel supported as they build real-world skills. You help elevate DevOps practices across projects, not just within your own delivery work. Explore our Culture and Values in action Equal Opportunities At Tecknuovo, we’re committed to creating an inclusive, barrier-free recruitment process and working environment for everyone. We want all candidates to have the best possible opportunity to succeed throughout their application. As a Disability Confident Committed employer, we actively encourage conversations about reasonable adjustments and will invite shortlisted candidates to share any adjustments they may need during the recruitment process.

### Job description
About the job We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back. We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅. We’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. About The Role And How We Work Hi 👋 I’m Colin, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along. Our infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure. Having herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve. We’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on: Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler, and create tools to help developers do so Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs. Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers. Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse. We’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take. Why you should or shouldn’t apply You Should Apply If You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure. You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things. You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better. You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process. You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you. Role All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if: You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it. You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use. You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day. Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you. You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile. Technology Stack I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis. We use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling. What We’re Building As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back. Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help. As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are! Engineering Culture Our Engineering Culture Is Motivated By Abhik And Benji’s (our Co-founders) Belief That a Small Talented Team, Given The Right Environment, Can Build High-quality Software Fast (and Work Regular Hours!). We Do It Through Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design Natural collaboration and deliberate communication Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage Putting effort into building a diverse team Minimal Process & Lots of Ownership The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise. Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.” At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive. Collaboration is Natural & Communication is Deliberate Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here). To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years: We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region. Increase Leverage, not Team Size We Built Ashby With The Quality, Breadth, And Depth That Many Customers Would Expect From Much Larger Teams Over Larger Time Scales. We’ve Done This Through Investment In Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾. Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below). And a Demo Of One Of These Building Blocks Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby: Put Effort into Diversity Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups. Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more. Interview Process At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises. Our Interview Process Is Three Rounds Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live) A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live) Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days) Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback! Your First Three Months at Ashby We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together. It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture. Benefits Competitive salary and equity. 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable. Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it. A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements. Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive! $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval. If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us. Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply. Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.

### Job description
About the job We’re looking for a curious, rigorous, problem-hungry platform engineer (who codes!) to carry the ball as we bring Ashby to the big leagues. Ashby builds software that lets talent teams build an efficient, delightful, respectful hiring process. Similarly, you’re an engineer who wants to build a “paved road” that excellent engineering teams can safely take to the moon and back. We have notable customers like Notion, Linear, Shopify, and Snowflake. Our growth and retention metrics are best-in-class among our peers: we have tens of millions in ARR, growing >100% year over year, over 2500 customers, very low churn, and many years of runway. We’ll share more details once we meet, but you now probably have a good idea as to why we're hiring for this role 😅. We’ve listed this role twice: as a Platform Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer – our team does both, and we are open to candidates who lean towards one or the other. About The Role And How We Work Hi 👋 I’m Colin, Head of EMEA Engineering. I’ve spent a number of years leading engineering teams in startups, and that has always included being close to infrastructure teams - no matter what name they’ve worn (SRE, infrastructure, platform, etc). I’ve got my hands dirty building the initial infrastructure for startups and know the value a talented infrastructure engineer brings. The rigour, the discipline, the peace and quiet when everything just hums along. Our infrastructure is in a good place for now. Nothing is static. Ashby continues to grow rapidly, putting strain on our existing infrastructure. We’re always looking to give our customers more powerful hiring software, and building new product features often requires new pieces of infrastructure. Having herded plenty of snowflakeservers in the past, I’ve learned there’s a better way. I (and Ashby) place a lot of value on infrastructure-as-code. As a Platform Engineer at Ashby, you’ll get to dive into scaling problems, add new capabilities to our platform, and think about how our entire team interacts with infrastructure. All our own engineers own their projects end-to-end and ship with minimal oversight. We don’t put roadblocks to ensure security when common sense will do and we don’t build processes like change management boards around the lowest common denominator. But with great power comes great responsibility: we handle personal and confidential data about some of the biggest decisions we ever make at work. As we grow, more and bigger customers rely on us to be reliable and secure and how we operate internally will need to evolve. We’re at an inflection point where our ability to scale and deliver a seamless experience has a make-or-break impact – we have some of the fastest growing companies using our platform every day to hire hundreds of people per month. We need someone like you to make good decisions, debug thorny issues, and build us a future-proof platform that can withstand this scale. Our small but mighty infrastructure team has set up a secure and simple environment (we don’t believe in spinning up a new service unless necessary!) for our growing product team to build in. That’s where you come in: you, too, will own projects end-to-end and have an impact on core parts of the Ashby developer and user experience. For instance, you could work on: Optimize our homegrown ultra-dynamic recruiting DSL-to-SQL compiler, and create tools to help developers do so Create automated guardrails for the security and privacy of our customer data Help our developers ship features fast through canary deploys, gradual rollouts and feature flags, while keeping complexity manageable and reducing downtime Work with the business and the engineering team to define SLOs and implement the corresponding SLIs. Ensure all communication with external services supports retries and circuit-breakers. Implement the infrastructure to support an event-driven architecture and data warehouse. We’re looking for someone who can build systems that an engineer would like to work with: mature and boring but open-minded and approachable. We have to balance reliability with flexibility. Software and its availability are now mission critical to almost every working professional. To be in an SRE in today’s world, you have to be extremely comfortable evaluating risk, those you take and those others take. Why you should or shouldn’t apply You Should Apply If You never stop. You get weirdly obsessed about a problem that doesn’t yet make sense, turn it every which way in your head until the explanation dawns. You’ll search every rock, inventory every clue, hunt every mismatch. We do that, too - together we’ll be armed with state-of-the-art monitoring tools and an impressive amount of data, and join you in the adventure. You don’t take shortcuts. You’re speaking up for the future user, the edge case, the doomsday design. You know product engineers want to build it with you, and see them as allies, where you give them the power and knowledge to access greater things. You’re someone who cares about what you do and the team you do it with, and want to work with others who do as well. You’ll be on interview panels choosing your next colleagues, and you’ll take that seriously. You only want to work with people who make you better, and want to make you better. You’ve built infrastructure at a slightly later stage than Ashby is at - you know how to deal with millions of data points, have seen great (or not great) infrastructure make or break customer experience, and have automated everything from provisioning to monitoring and release process. You’re a Swiss army knife (all nationalities welcome ;) ). You’ll get every hard problem the company faces. You’ll get to do infrastructure updates, security enforcements, database optimization, Kubernetes debugging, and digging through Typescript traces figuring out what doesn’t work. You probably don’t feel like an expert at at least some of that... and that appeals to you. Role All that makes for a pretty specific kind of role, and the job isn’t to everyone’s tastes! You should not apply if: You don’t want to make your own decisions on what is the best paved road to build for Ashby, and expect a lead or manager to make the final call on what that is. Our leads (and managers) give ample commentary and feedback on technical decisions and how they’re made, but you ship what you want to build and are accountable for it. You hate SQL. We have a lot of features built around making the best out of data, and our platform engineers also sometimes dive into a gnarly report or advise engineers on a more performant data model to use. You don’t want to code. Our SREs are some of our best software engineers and they are just as responsible for the application as the other engineering teams - albeit at a platform level. Reviewing code and submitting code changes will be part of your day to day. Your primary mode of communicating best practices to engineers is live meetings. We’re a very async culture and written communication (and code) is how changes get made. As an Ashby SRE, you will need to share new tooling and best practices with engineers faster than your next meeting opportunity will take you. You’ve never delivered a project, on your own, without someone prodding you for updates. We have no project or delivery managers to fill your calendar with busy work, but the flip side is you have to do your project management, seek the help you need to get unstuck and cut scope when it’s worthwhile. Technology Stack I’m sharing our tech stack with the caveat that we don’t require previous experience in it: TypeScript (frontend & backend), Node.js, React, Apollo GraphQL, Postgres, Redis. We use Datadog and Sentry on 100% cloud-based (AWS) infra. We take developer experience and reliability seriously: all engineers are on call in a follow-the-sun model, and everyone contributes to developer tooling. What We’re Building As engineers, we are used to tooling that makes us better at what we do. When we started Ashby, we saw the opposite with Talent Acquisition software. Recruiting teams were leveling up how they did their work, but instead of software meeting this new standard, it held them back. Scheduling a final round is an excellent example. Recruiting teams wanted to schedule candidates faster, track interviewer preparation and quality, and do it with half the headcount. A recruiter needed to manually collect availability from the candidate, identify qualified interviewers, perform “Calendar Tetris” to find who is available to interview the candidate, schedule on the earliest date possible, and make any last-minute adjustments as availability changed. They must do this while considering the interview load on each individual and whether interviewers need to be trained and shadowing others. 🥵 TA software didn’t help. As hiring managers, we know TA is a critical function, and as engineers, we know software can do better. So, we built and continue to build Ashby to give TA teams the highest standard of tooling. Software that’s intelligent and powerful. Software that provides insights into where they’re failing and automates or simplifies many of the tasks they’re underwater with. We want other functions and departments to be jealous of what TA teams can do with Ashby, and today they often are! Engineering Culture Our Engineering Culture Is Motivated By Abhik And Benji’s (our Co-founders) Belief That a Small Talented Team, Given The Right Environment, Can Build High-quality Software Fast (and Work Regular Hours!). We Do It Through Minimal process with ownership over decisions normally made by product and design Natural collaboration and deliberate communication Investing in tools and abstractions that give us leverage Putting effort into building a diverse team Minimal Process & Lots of Ownership The best engineers we’ve worked with delivered reliably magical outcomes. They took customer problems and relentlessly drove them to solutions that were not only successful but often brilliant and creative. While they did this with minimal oversight, stakeholders were never in the dark as to what was going on, and no setback was a surprise. Traditional product-development processes aren’t meant for the best engineers. Their purpose is to create consistent outcomes regardless of the engineer’s skill. But, consistency comes at the expense of an engineer’s time and freedom—both ingredients necessary to generate those magical outcomes. As a result, process stifles the best engineers and doesn’t give others the opportunity to practice the behaviors that made the best engineers the “best.” At Ashby, we want to build an environment that encourages every engineer to be their best. So, at Ashby, every Engineer runs their project. Product Managers (and Designers) build strategy, do customer research, and hand off problem briefs to Engineers. Engineers take on the rest: they research the problem, write product specs, build wireframes, and implement their solution end-to-end. We rely on engineers, not process, to push information outward to the relevant folks (e.g., Product Managers) and pull folks in to help (e.g., Designers, Infra). It’s a new level of ownership for many engineers, but we’d rather an engineer fail a bit and coach up their skills than use process as a crutch. Not everyone succeeds in our culture, but those who do thrive. Collaboration is Natural & Communication is Deliberate Our engineering team consists of lifelong learners who are talented but also humble and kind (meet them here!). These attributes create an environment where collaboration happens naturally. We combine this with research, prototyping, and written proposals to see around corners and get feedback from the team across time zones. Focus time is something that we hold sacred, and, with thoughtful and deliberate communication, engineers are in <2h meetings per week (Abhik wrote about it here). To drive it home, here's a recent calendar of an engineer who has been with us for over 4 years: We also meet in person at least twice a year, once as a department and once as a company. You also have a small budget to meet up with folks in your city/region. Increase Leverage, not Team Size We Built Ashby With The Quality, Breadth, And Depth That Many Customers Would Expect From Much Larger Teams Over Larger Time Scales. We’ve Done This Through Investment In Great developer tooling. Our CI/CD takes ~10m, and we deploy at least 15x a day. A debugger that works out of the box. Everyone on the team has contributed to our developer experience 💪🏾. Building blocks to create powerful and customizable products fast. At the core of Ashby is a set of common components (analytics modeling and query language, policy engine, workflow engine, design system) that we constantly improve. Each improvement to a common component cascades throughout our app (short video below). And a Demo Of One Of These Building Blocks Here’s an impromptu quote from Arjun in our company Slack of what it’s like to build a feature at Ashby: Put Effort into Diversity Diverse teams drive innovation and better outcomes. Having seen my mother and partner build their careers as minority women in non-diverse fields, I want to make sure Ashby creates opportunities for the next generation of engineers from underrepresented groups. Today, 21% of engineers at Ashby are from underrepresented groups. It’s not great, and we are taking conscious steps to improve, like sourcing diverse candidates, providing generous paid family leave, no leetcode interviews, and more. Interview Process At Ashby, our team and interview process want to help you show your best self. We’ll dive into past projects and simulate working together via pair programming, writing product and tech specs collaboratively, and talking through decisions. There are no leetcode or whiteboard exercises. Our Interview Process Is Three Rounds Introduction call with Hiring Manager (15 to 30m, live) A technical screen where we pair in our actual codebase (1h, live) Three non-coding interviews that focus on technical design, debugging incidents, and infrastructure (3h 15m, live can be split across multiple days) Depending on our leadership team’s bandwidth, we may start with an additional 30m screen with a recruiter. Your hiring manager will be your main point of contact and prep you for interviews. Each round will have written guidance so you know what to expect (you’ll need minimal preparation). You’ll meet 4 to 6 people in engineering (with 5-15 minutes in each interview to ask them questions). If we don’t give an offer, we’ll provide feedback! Your First Three Months at Ashby We want an exceptional onboarding experience for every new hire. At Ashby, your dev environment is set up with a single script, you push your first product change on day one, and you spend the rest of your time shipping product changes that give you a tour of our codebase and best practices. The product changes increase in scope and ambiguity from simple copy changes to the delivery of a prominent, impactful feature. Your manager will do a 30, 60, and 90-day review to give feedback and calibrate on how we work together. It’s a team effort to get you successfully onboarded; you’ll have a peer paired with you to answer questions, pair program, and check in often to see if you need help. The rest of the team will run training sessions on our culture, product, engineering process, and technical architecture. Benefits Competitive salary and equity. 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable. Unlimited PTO, and we will encourage you to take it. A minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid parental leave, covered by Ashby. For folks outside the US, it may be longer to be in line with regional requirements. Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive! $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval. If you’re in the US, we offer top-tier health insurance for you and your dependents, with 100% of premiums covered by Ashby. In other countries, we provide high-quality supplemental health insurance for you and your dependents, also fully covered by us. Ashby’s success hinges on hiring great people and creating an environment where we can be happy, feel challenged, and do our best work. We’re being deliberate about building that environment from the ground up. I hope that excites you enough to apply. Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.
